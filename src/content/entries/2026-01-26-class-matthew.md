Session with Matthew covering **polyrhythm** and **polymeter** — two ways of layering conflicting rhythmic patterns.

## Definitions

- **Polyrhythm**: Two or more rhythms with different subdivisions played simultaneously over the *same* time span. Example: 3 against 2 (triplets over eighth notes) — both patterns resolve at the same downbeat.
- **Polymeter**: Two or more meters running simultaneously with the *same* subdivision but different groupings. Example: 3/4 against 4/4 — same tempo, but the downbeats drift apart and only realign after a full cycle (12 beats in this case).

## Creating them in Tempera and Renoise

- **Tempera**: Use multiple lanes with different time signatures or loop lengths. Set one lane to a 3-step pattern and another to a 4-step pattern at the same BPM — the offset between them creates polymeter naturally.
- **Renoise**: Use the delay column (Dx) to shift note positions for polyrhythmic feel. For polymeter, set different pattern lengths per track using the phrase editor — a 12-row phrase on one track against a 16-row phrase on another gives you 3 vs 4.
