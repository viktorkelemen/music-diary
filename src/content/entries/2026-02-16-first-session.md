Worked through **C major** and **A minor** scales today, focusing on evenness and tone.

## What went well

- Smooth transitions between positions
- Consistent tempo at 80 BPM

## What to improve

- Right hand pinky needs more strength
- Try the same exercises in **D major** next time

*Mood: Focused and calm.*
