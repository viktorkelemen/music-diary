Deep dive into **Clicks & Cuts** — a movement in experimental electronic music where artists deliberately embraced digital errors, glitches, and sonic artifacts as primary creative material. Named after the Mille Plateaux compilation series (2000).

## Key Artists

- **Oval** (Markus Popp) — physically damaged CDs to create glitch loops
- **Alva Noto** (Carsten Nicolai) — sine waves, granular synthesis, co-founded Raster-Noton
- **Ryoji Ikeda** — ultra-minimalist, converts data into sound and barcode visuals
- **Pole** (Stefan Betke) — dub meets glitch via a broken Waldorf 4-Pole filter
- **Pan Sonic** — raw analog minimalism, self-built electronics
- **Fennesz** — guitar processed through laptops into lush glitch textures
- **Richard Devine** — all-modular records, essential reference for Eurorack C&C

## Sonic Palette

Microscopic clicks & pops, digital buffer glitches, extreme frequency exploration, pointillist textures, dub-influenced bass and space, granular clouds, and silence as a compositional element.

## Modular Synth Artists

The original C&C movement was largely laptop/software-based — the modular world inherited and evolved the aesthetic as Eurorack exploded. These artists bridge the two worlds:

- **Richard Devine** — the most direct overlap. Last three records made entirely out-of-the-box on his massive Eurorack system. Rapid clicks, metallic thrums, scattering beats — clicks & cuts realized in hardware
- **Keith Fullerton Whitman** — moved from laptop glitch (*Playthroughs*) into hybrid digital-analog modular. His album *Occlusions* is subtitled "Real Time Music for Hybrid Digital-Analogue Modular Synthesizer"
- **Pan Sonic** (Mika Vainio) — self-built electronics and raw analog circuits. Not Eurorack, but fully in the spirit of DIY hardware minimalism
- **Marcus Fischer** — Eurorack, tape loops, and field recordings in a quiet microsound aesthetic. More restrained than Devine but very much in the genre
- **Mouse on Mars** — Jan St. Werner collaborated with Peter Blasser (Ciat-Lonbarde) to create the Clicker, a synth for "microsecond orchestras" — clicks & cuts philosophy made physical
- **Hainbach** — Ciat-Lonbarde synths, test equipment, and Eurorack for glitchy ambient textures

Notable hardware: **Møffenzeef Mødular** built Eurorack modules specifically for clicks & cuts style glitch percussion.

## Modular Synth Takeaways

- **Sound sources:** Granular modules (Morphagene, Arbhar), ultrashort envelopes (<1ms = click), FM at extreme ratios, self-oscillating filters
- **Processing:** Extreme bandpass filtering, sample & hold for bit-crush, wavefolder distortion, feedback through delay lines
- **Sequencing:** Chaotic clock sources, probabilistic triggers (Marbles, Branches), Bernoulli gates, sub-audio LFOs modulating everything slowly
